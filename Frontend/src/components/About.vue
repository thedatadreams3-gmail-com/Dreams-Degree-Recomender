        Learning Analytics (LA) has attracted a great deal of attention as practitioners, institutions, and researchers are increasingly seeing the potential that LA has to shape the future technology-enhanced learning landscape. LA is an emerging data science field that represents the application of big data and analytics in education. It deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. LA is an interdisciplinary field involving competences from computer science, cognitive psychology, and pedagogy.
